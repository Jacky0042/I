        <p class="par">We are a non-profit organization based in kenya.So far we have been able to rescue more than 100 maasai girls from undergoing female genital mutilation.We have a mission to save many more but it is a difficult and expensive task.We want to speak for the girls who have been silenced by their own parents and culture and forced to undergo a process that will make them not to enjoy or feel sex for the rest of their lives in the name of culture.We want to ask you,on their behalf, to stand with us.No donation is small.</p>
