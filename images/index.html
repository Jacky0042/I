            <h3>What is Female Genital Mutilation?</h3>
            <P>FGM has no health benefits, and it harms girls and women in many ways. The practice involves removing and injuring healthy and normal female genital tissue, interfering with the natural functions of girls' and women's bodies. It can lead to immediate health risks, as well as a variety of long-term complications affecting women’s physical, mental and sexual health and well-being throughout the life-course.   

                All forms of FGM are associated with increased health risk in the short- and long-term. FGM is a harmful practice and is unacceptable from a human rights as well as a public health perspective, regardless of who performs it. Some health care providers perform FGM (medicalization), but WHO is opposed to all forms of FGM and strongly urges health care providers to not carry out FGM even when their patient or their patient’s family requests it.</P>

            <h3>Who we Are</h3>
            <p>My Name is Lenaola lenard,a  maasai moran and a teacher who has decided to dedicate his life to save all the girls in my community who are at risk of undergoing this evil practice directed to our girls.In the year 2020,my father and family members forcefully circumcised my older sister,despite her please,she was forced to face the knife.Unfortunately for her she died three days later from excessive bleeding,something which greatly affected me and my other sisters so much and it also inspired us not to let another girl pass through what she went through.I come from a family which strongly support this archaic practice and due to that my father disowned me and my sisters who are activist against this practice.For the last 2 years we have been able to rescue more than 100 girls from undegoing this practice all of whom were later disown by their families for bringing "shame" to them and others had to flee to save themselves.
                 With the help of well-wishers we have been able to take this children back to school so that they can continue with their studies.</p>
